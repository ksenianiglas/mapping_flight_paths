# Mapping flights paths in R
This code creates an animation of flight paths in R (like flights.gif)

flightdiary_2020_04_13_11_40.csv is my perosnal flight data from https://my.flightradar24.com/
worldcities.csv is a dataset of city coordinates I obtained from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities
